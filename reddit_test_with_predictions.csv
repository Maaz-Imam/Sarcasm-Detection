I'm not going to buy n+1 services just to get one show - and really it's the shows I want. I couldn't care less about whether it's netflix, amazon or diddlytwat streaming services, it's the shows that I want to watch.

Content makers are going to have to sell their stuff on all of these platforms if they want to get to their audience.

At the moment we share a netflix account, but I would like to see fear the Walking dead - which in the UK is exclusive to BT, and maybe the alternative Top Gear, which is exclusive to Amazon.

I'm not going to pay for 3 services. Especially not on top of a broadband/cable TV package.

The most logical solution for audience members is to torrent the shows that aren't shown on whichever streaming service they pay for. At which point a feature like 'offline viewing for some of our content but not all' is not really a feature at all, it's just a ridiculous thing to have stopped you doing in the first place only to add back as though it's an innovation.

So really, the service that wins will be the service that gets the content without seeking out ""exclusives"" - cf steam. Thinking about ways of screwing the audience for a show unless they pay you just makes your service suck.
